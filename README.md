# KodeWilayahAPI

KodeWilayahAPI is a TypeScript and Express RESTful API providing structured Indonesian region codes (Kode Wilayah) down to the village level. Based on **Permendagri No. 72/2019** from Indonesiaâ€™s Ministry of Home Affairs (Kemendagri), this API standardizes administrative codes for provinces, cities, districts, and villages.

KodeWilayahAPI simplifies integration for developers and organizations needing accurate regional data, making it ideal for location-based services, government projects, and applications requiring detailed administrative regions. The data is sourced from the [kodewilayah.id](https://kodewilayah.id/), formatted in JSON for easy use
